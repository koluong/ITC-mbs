Mashup web application that displays desired aggregate information about different neighborhoods.

## Web Development Case
Before you move to a new place, it would be useful to know the neighborhood, and it would be wonderful if most of the desired information can be aggregated and found in just one website.

### Requirements
In web development, a mashup extracts content from different sources, aggregates the content, and displays enriched results. In this project, you develop a mashup web application that uses a location, such as an address, as input, combines information from different free sources, and displays various results which may include but are not limited the following.

• What amenities (such as restaurants, grocery stores, superstores, fitness centers, banks, parks, schools, universities, libraries, post office, etc.) are nearby the particular location? What are their distances to the location and their ratings and reviews if applicable?
• How convenient is this location to major public transportations, such as distances to nearby highways, subway or train stations, airports, etc.?
• How safe is this area, such as crime-related information?
• What is the weather in the next few days and year around?
• What nearby properties are currently on the market for sale and what are their
attributes, such as numbers of bedroom and bathroom, sizes of living space, lot sizes,
listing prices, years built, distances to the given location, etc.
• What nearby properties are currently on the market for rent and what are their
attributes, such as numbers of bedroom and bathroom, sizes of living space, rental rates, distances to the given location, etc.
